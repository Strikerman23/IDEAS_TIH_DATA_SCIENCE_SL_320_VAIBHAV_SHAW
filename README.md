Overview of the Streamlit App: Interactive Data Explorer
This Streamlit app is a simple and interactive data exploration tool that allows users to filter and visualize data related to different fruits. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

ðŸ”¹ Dataset
A sample dataset is loaded using the load_data() function.

This dataset contains 3 columns:

Fruit: Names of fruits.

Quantity: Number of each fruit available.

Price: Price per unit of each fruit.

The dataset is displayed using st.dataframe() to allow interactive exploration.

ðŸ”¹ Sidebar Filter
A sidebar widget allows the user to select one or more fruits from a list.

The selection is done via a multiselect dropdown.

By default, all fruits are selected.

ðŸ”¹ Filtered Data Display
Based on the selected fruits from the sidebar, the app filters the dataset.

The filtered dataset is shown in another interactive table.

ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization
A bar chart is generated using Matplotlib.

The chart visualizes the quantity of selected fruits.

The chart includes:

X-axis: Fruit names.

Y-axis: Quantities.

Title: "Quantity of Selected Fruits".
